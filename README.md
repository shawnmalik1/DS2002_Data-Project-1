# DS2002_Data Project 1
Project Members: Shawn Malik and Maggie Dykstra


## How to Use:

1. Ensure you have the historical weather data available (```daily_weather_data.csv```) in your project directory
2. Run the script, and when prompted enter a capital city name (ex: London), A valid month (number between 1-12), a valid day (number between 1-31), and desired output format.
3. The script will print summaries of the original and transformed datasets, along with a bar chart comparing the historical and predicted temperatures for the city. Additionally, the transformed data file in your desired output format and the SQLite database file (weather_data.db) are created/updated.
